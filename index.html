        <h1>hello, i'm afra!</h1>

        <div class="content">
            <p>I'm a writer, researcher, podcaster, tech/crypto growth and marketing specialist, ex-news editor.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Grew up in China until age 17.</li>
                <li>Spent the rest of my life in California, New York City, and London.</li>
                <li>Consider the internet my actual hometown.</li>
                <li>Have a knack for catching up with cultural zeitgeists.</li>
                <li>Studied international history and media studies at Columbia, LSE, and UC Irvine.</li>
                <li>Worked in Silicon Valley for 5 years in AI, media, and crypto.</li>
                <li>Currently living in Mountain View, California and London.</li>
                <li>Bilingual in English and Chinese.</li>
                <li>Sometimes angel invest in early startups in AI and crypto.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>What keeps me busy these days:</strong></p>
            
            <p>I write a newsletter, <a href="https://afraw.substack.com/" target="_blank">Concurrent</a>, focuses on the parallel and colliding tech and cultural currents shaping Silicon Valley, China, and beyond. </p>

            <p>I host a podcast called <a href="#">CyberPink</a> (in Mandarin Chinese). It explores contemporary zeitgeists, culture, society, and includes movie reviews. With over 55+ episodes released.</p>
            
            <p>My reading lately gravitates toward the archaeology of our technological present: the forgotten genealogies of artificial intelligence, the evolution of digital media as both liberation and constraint, the cybernetic dreams. I'm particularly drawn to the spaces where seemingly disparate currents meet—how counterculture movements seeded today's tech utopias, how Chinese industrialization both mirrors and subverts Western modernization narratives, how the colonial logic embedded in "progress" continues to shape global technology flows. Literature and fiction provide essential counterpoint to these inquiries.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Other obsessions:</strong> I occasionally paint (oil painting, soft oil pastel, acrylic, traditional Chinese ink painting). Visiting museums. I feel alive and deeply connected to nature when snowboarding, mountain biking, and hiking. </p>

                People are made of stories. Our memories are not the impartial accumulation of every second we've lived; they're the narrative that we assembled out of selected moments.

            <div class="quote">
                I have stolen ideas from every book I've ever read. My principle for researching a novel is 'Read like a butterfly, write like a bee,' and if this story contains any honey, it is because of the quality of the nectar I have found in the work of better writers.

            <div class="quote">
                Infrastructures are matter that enable the movement of other matter. Their peculiar ontology lies in the facts that they are things and also the relation between things. As things they are present to the senses, yet they are also displaced in the focus on the matter they move around. We often see computers not cables, light not electricity, taps and water but not pipes and sewers.

            <div class="quote">
                In its collective sense, technology is not merely a catalog of individual parts. It is a metabolic chemistry, an almost limitless collective of entities that interact to produce new entities-and further needs. And we should not forget that needs drive the evolution of technology every bit as much as the possibilities for fresh combination and the unearthing of phenomena. Without the presence of unmet needs, nothing novel would appear in technology.
