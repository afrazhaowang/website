        <h1>hello, i'm afra!</h1>

        <div class="content">
            <p>I'm a freelance writer, researcher, podcaster, tech/crypto growth and marketing specialist, ex-news editor.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Grew up in China until age 17.</li>
                <li>Spent the rest of my life in California, New York City, and London.</li>
                <li>Consider the internet my actual hometown.</li>
                <li>Have a knack for catching up with cultural zeitgeists.</li>
                <li>Studied international history and media studies at Columbia, LSE, and UC Irvine.</li>
                <li>Worked in Silicon Valley for 5 years in AI, media, and crypto.</li>
                <li>Currently living in Mountain View, California and London.</li>
                <li>Bilingual in English and Chinese.</li>
                <li>Sometimes angel invest in early startups in AI and crypto.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>What keeps me busy these days:</strong></p>
            
            <p>I write a newsletter, <a href="https://afraw.substack.com/" target="_blank">Concurrent</a>, which explores the parallel and divergent tech/cultural currents flowing through Silicon Valley, China, and the world. </p>

            <p>I host a podcast called <a href="#">CyberPink</a> (in Mandarin Chinese). It explores contemporary zeitgeists, culture, society, and includes movie reviews. With over 55+ episodes released, it's where I channel most of my creative energy.</p>
            
            <p>I am avidly reading about diverse topics recently, including: the history of AI and information technology, digital media evolution, cybernetics, counterculture movements, futurism, cultural identity, immigration, Chinese industrialization history, the interplay between modernization and colonialism. I also read literature and fiction.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Other obsessions:</strong> I occasionally paint (oil painting, soft oil pastel, acrylic, traditional Chinese ink painting). Visiting museums gives me highs. I feel alive and deeply connected to nature when snowboarding, mountain biking, and hiking. I love cooking! A cinephile myself, I always need movie recommendations.</p>

                I have stolen ideas from every book I've ever read. My principle for researching a novel is 'Read like a butterfly, write like a bee,' and if this story contains any honey, it is because of the quality of the nectar I have found in the work of better writers.

            <div class="quote">
                Infrastructures are matter that enable the movement of other matter. Their peculiar ontology lies in the facts that they are things and also the relation between things. As things they are present to the senses, yet they are also displaced in the focus on the matter they move around. We often see computers not cables, light not electricity, taps and water but not pipes and sewers.
