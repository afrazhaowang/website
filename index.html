<h3>Other obsessions:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>I occasionally paint (oil painting, soft oil pastel, acrylic, traditional Chinese ink painting)</li>
    <li>Visiting museums gives me highs</li>
    <li>I feel alive and deeply connected to nature when snowboarding, mountain biking, and hiking</li>
    <li>I occasionally indulge myself in rabbit holes of Isamu Noguchi, I.M. Pei, Tadao Ando, Nam June Paik, Xu Bing, Cao Fei, and many, many other artists</li>
    <li>I love cooking(!)</li>
    <li>A cinephile myself, I always need movie recommendations. I shall not expand because that's a topic that needs many more pages.</li>
